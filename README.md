# Movie-Dataset-Creation

Solving real World Data Science task using Python Beautiful Soup!

**Task-**
Scrapping Wikipedia page to create a dataset on Disney Movies.

**Project flow-**
- Web Scrapping with Beautiful Soup
- Cleaning data
- Testing code with pytest
- Pattern matching with regular expression (Re library)
- Working with Dates (datetime Library)
- Saving and Loading Data with Pickle Library
- Accessing data from an API using Request Library

**Objective of the Project**

1. Data Collection 

collecting the data from wikipedia

2. Analysis 

Movie datasets can be used to analyze various aspects of the film industry, 
such as box office performance, critical reception, genre trends, 
and audience demographics. This can be useful for film studios, 
distributors, investors, and marketers who want to make informed 
decisions about which movies to produce, distribute, or market

3. Research 

Movie datasets can be used by researchers to investigate various topics 
related to film, such as cultural representation, gender 
and racial disparities, and the impact of movies on society. 
This can lead to a better understanding of the film industry and its role 
in shaping culture

4. Content Creation 

Scraped movie data can be used to create interesting and informative 
content such as movie reviews, rankings, and lists.

5. Machine learning: 

Movie datasets can be used as training data for 
machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data 
that can be used to predict various aspects of a movie's success 
such as box office performance, critical acclaim or audience reception.


web scraping movie datasets can provide valuable insights for various 
stakeholders in the film industry and beyond, 
and can also lead to the development of new tools and services that can 
benefit movie lovers and casual audiences.
